				  Imminent is a card game with a grid covering mechanism that simulates managing one's personal schedule while studying isolated in a spaceship. The player must add cards to their deck and avoid anxiety to keep their motivation high and reach a passing grade.

			  <h2>Early Prototyping</h2>
			  <p class="tagline">
				  We were a group inspired by card games, and with Ubisoft's 2022 theme of "student life during a pandemic," we discussed our own feelings of isolation during COVID to brainstorm ideas for a card game with an isolated feeling.
			  </p>
			  <div class="two-col">
				  <div>
					  <p>
						  We defined a gameplay loop around time-grid scheduling, deck-building, and student-life resource management. After evaluating ideas, the team converged on:
					  </p>
					  <ul>
						  <li>A schedule-grid where cards place tetromino-style time blocks.</li>
						  <li>Motivation, Anxiety, Connection stats affected by card effects..</li>
						  <li>A Discussion Board as a pseudo-multiplayer feature using real text input. (To satisfy Ubisoft's multiplayer requirement)</li>
						  <li>A procedural Event system that affects rounds..</li>
					  </ul>

			  <h2>General Gameplay Summary</h2>
			  <div class="two-col">
				  <div>
					  <p>
						  Imminent is a turn-based, deck-building schedule-management game set over a 20-week “semester” aboard a futuristic terraforming pod. Each week, the player draws a hand of cards—each representing an activity shaped like a polyomino—that must be fitted onto a weekly schedule grid.
					  </p>
					  <p>
						  Playing a card grants positive effects (like raising Grades or Motivation), while leaving a card unplayed inflicts penalties. Drawing cards is dangerous: unplayed Study cards increase Anxiety, and Anxiety cards themselves automatically block random schedule slots when drawn. The player must maintain two main stats:
					  </p>
					  <ul>
						  Motivation (falls when overworked, game over at 0)
						  Grades (must be at 60 by weeks 10 and 20)
					  </ul>
					  <p>
						  Every two weeks, the player encounters an Event, choosing between two outcomes that modify the week, add new cards, or alter their deck. After each early event, the player selects one of three new cards to add to their discard pile, slowly shaping their long-term strategy.
					  </p>
					  <p>
						  Starting in week 5, the player may optionally visit an online Class Discussion Board, typing a message that is analyzed for positive or negative sentiment. Venting raises Motivation but lowers global “karma,” while positive messages do the opposite. The global karma value, shared across all players through an online database, determines whether the player earns Connection cards (removing Anxiety) or additional Anxiety cards.
					  </p>
					  <p>
						  Throughout the game, an unseen AI-driven event system chooses upcoming events based on the player’s condition, ensuring narrative variety and escalating pressures.
					  </p>
					  <p>
						  The player wins by successfully completing both semesters—maintaining Motivation and reaching required Grade thresholds—while navigating increasing Anxiety, tightening schedule space, and the unpredictable events of life aboard the pod.
